# Rating
This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that replaces customizable code snippets with user-defined rating symbols.

For example, if you have the code snippet <code>\`$-3/5\`</code>, it will be replaced with ★★★☆☆.

You can define which unicode characters or emojis you’d like to use for filled strokes (eg. ★) and empty strokes (eg. ☆) under **Settings → Rating**.

Currently, this plugin only works in **Reading view**. I am planning on adding a dynamically changing rating for **Live Preview** in the future. Until then, feel free to use this plugin as-is!
